# Seinfeld text corpus

![banner](https://i.redd.it/5i5hph5aliw01.png)

Seinfeld is my favorite TV show. I wrote [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/luonglearnstocode/Seinfeld-text-corpus/blob/master/scraper.ipynb) to scrape the scripts of all Seinfeld episodes from the site [seinology.com](http://www.seinology.com) and merge them into a text corpus so that I could train a language model. Hope you could find it useful. Any feedback would be appreciated.
